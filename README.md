Coding practice

This program was written in Java on a Unix based Mac OS system. 
There are instances where file i/o is done and new line characters are used in strings using the Unix standard, which may cause issues in a Windows environment.

I have also debugged the program, but certainly have not caught all potential bugs. 
I am also continuing to add comments to the files to explain some of the convoluted parts of the code.

The main Java class is in the Runner.java file and has an example instance ready to run. This can be changed to test out program behavior.
At the moment the Runner class also writes output to a file, which is created in the same directory as the "src" folder. These files are given a random number in their name to differentiate them.
